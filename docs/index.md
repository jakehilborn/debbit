## Getting Started

1. Install the latest version of Firefox.

1. Download [debbit](https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/releases) if you haven't done so yet, then unzip the download.

1. Run debbit to see a (fake) example purchase, refer to your operating system:  

* **macOS**: Double click on `debbit`. If using Catalina, to run for the first time right click on `debbit`, click Open, and then click the Open button. If you still see the error "debbit is damaged", read the bit about macOS catalina on the [releases](https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/releases) page for how to bypass this.

* **Windows**: Double click on `debbit_keep_window_open.bat`. On the first run you may see a Defender SmartScreen pop-up. If so, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`. If you get a pop-up about your Firewall, click Cancel since Debbit does not need Firewall access.

* **Linux**: [Instructions here](https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/blob/master/src/HOW_TO_RUN_FROM_SOURCE.md)

1. To make debbit work for real, edit the file config.txt. Refer to [config.txt Explanation](#configtxt-explanation) for info. **Important**: config.txt must have the correct structure (spaces, `:`'s, etc.), [config.txt Example](#configtxt-example) is a good resource to copy/paste and then edit the bits you need.

1. Debbit was built to be a set it and forget solution. It will run month to month automatically scheduling and executing purchases to meet your spending requirements. After seeing how it works, you'll want to set `hide_web_browser: yes` so Firefox stops popping up on your screen while you're using your computer. You may also want to make debbit automatically run when your computer starts up:

- [Windows instructions](https://jakehilborn.github.io/debbit/windows-auto-run)

## F.A.Q.

#### What is Debbit?
Read about Debbit [here](https://jakehilborn.github.io/debbit/about).

#### Where do I sign up for a high interest checking account?
Visit this [Doctor of Credit](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/#Mega_High-Interest_Nationwide) page. Regional banks will typically offer the best returns. If you can't find a regional bank you qualify for, select a nationwide bank.

#### How do I update debbit?
Download and unzip the latest release from [here](https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/releases). Go to the folder where you've been using debbit. Stop debbit if it is running. Then, copy `config.txt` and the `state` folder to the new debbit version you downloaded. Read [this guide](https://jakehilborn.github.io/debbit/v1-to-v2) if you're upgrading from debbit v1.0.

#### How do I see how many purchases debbit has made?
Open the folder `state` and click the file for this month. It will show `purchase_count` for each merchant.

#### Can debbit run in headless mode?
Yes. Edit `config.txt` and set `hide_web_browser: yes`

#### Does my computer have to stay on?
No, you do not need to leave your computer on all the time. Debbit works in two different ways based on what's in config.txt.

`mode: burst`
Best if using a laptop or a computer that is not always on. Debbit will check every 5 minutes if enough time has elapsed such that it should execute purchases. This allows you to sleep your computer without concern for debbit. Whenever your computer is back on, debbit will check if it is time to execute purchases and do so accordingly.

`mode: spread`
Best if running on a server/computer that never sleeps. Debbit will spread out purchases through the month as evenly as possible (with some randomness).

#### What if I reboot my computer?
Rebooting will cause no issues, other than you'll need to run debbit again after starting up. Follow these instructions for [macOS](https://jakehilborn.github.io/debbit/macOS-auto-run) or [Windows](https://jakehilborn.github.io/debbit/windows-auto-run) to automatically run on start up.

#### Will rebooting lose monthly progress?
No. Debbit stores its progress through the month in files inside the `state` folder. You can stop/start debbit whenever and reboot whenever without concern for debbit. It is built to handle all these scenarios.

#### How do I check if debbit is running?
Debbit runs as a foreground application. On Windows it will show as a Command Prompt window in the taskbar. On macOS it will show as a Terminal window in the dock. If debbit fails to execute a purchase after 5 retries, an email will be sent to the email address in `config.txt` as a notification. 

#### Can debbit use multiple cards?
Yes, refer to the section [config.txt Example](#configtxt-example) for an example of two debit cards being used. One named blue_debbit_card, the other named red_debbit_card. Debbit supports an unlimited number of cards in config.txt.

#### Will debbit accidentally spend money?
No. Debbit ensures that the correct amount is input and the correct payment method is selected before clicking purchase. If the webpage is not exactly as debbit expects, debbit will error-out preemptively and notify you so that debbit avoids spending money. If debbit clicks "purchase" but cannot verify the purchase was successful, it will error out and notify you and not schedule any future purchases until you re-run debbit. 

#### Does my debit card need to be the default card on my account?
No. Debbit automation will always click the payment method specified in config.txt before making a purchase. Whatever payment method is default in your account is irrelevant.

#### Merchant automation failed, how do I get it fixed?
The best way is to set `send_failures_to_developer: yes` in config.txt so error reports are automatically sent to the debbit developer to be investigated and fixed. Alternatively, in the `failures` folder there will be files with timestamps for names. Each timestamp will have 4 pieces ending in `.txt`, `.png`, `.html`, and a folder ending in `coverage`. Email these three files to jakehilborn@gmail.com or open an Issue on GitHub and attach them there. You can attach one error or all of them, the more errors to inspect the more helpful.

#### Can debbit automate purchases for other websites?
Yes, please open an issue on GitHub and I'll work with you to get it automated. Alternatively, download the source code and refer to [example_merchant.py](https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/blob/master/src/program_files/merchants/example_merchant.py) as a reference to code your own.
