These instructions will vary somewhat depending on your platform. For example,
if your system already has Python3 then you'll use `pip` instead of `pip3`. If
you don't have pip installed, search on Google for how to install pip.

# install pipenv
pip3 install --user pipenv
pip3 install --user --upgrade pipenv

cd debbit/src

# install dependencies listed in Pipfile
pipenv install

# activate pipshell
pipenv shell

# run debbit
./debbit.py
