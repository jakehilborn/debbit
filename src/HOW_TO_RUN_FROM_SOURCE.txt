If you want to use debbit on mac/Windows please download a release from https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/releases
If you want to develop debbit or use on Linux follow instructions below.

0. Clone this GitHub repo or download the source code
1. Install the latest version of Firefox
2. Download the latest `geckodriver` for your OS from here https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
    Extract the zip/tar.gz and place `geckodriver` (or `geckodriver.exe`) in the `debbit/src/program_files` directory, which is directly under the same folder as `debbit.py` is in.
    a. If using Windows, you will need to rename `geckodriver.exe` to `geckodriver`
    b. Alternatively, if using Mac, you can `brew install geckodriver` and symlink it into this directory (`ln -s /usr/local/bin/geckodriver geckodriver`)
3. Copy and rename the file `sample_config.txt` to `config.txt` (or `config.yml`) in the same directory
4. Configure your python3 environment and dependencies. All of the following commands must be run from the `debbit/src` directory.

One time setup: 
    These instructions will vary somewhat depending on your platform. For example,
    if your system already has Python3 then you'll use `pip` instead of `pip3`. If
    you don't have pip installed, search on Google for how to install pip.

    # install pipenv
    pip3 install --user pipenv
    pip3 install --user --upgrade pipenv

Routinely, when dependencies are updated:
    # install dependencies listed in Pipfile
    pipenv install

Every time:
    # run debbit via pipenv
    pipenv run python debbit.py
