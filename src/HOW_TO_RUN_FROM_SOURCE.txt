If you want to use debbit on mac/Windows please download a release from https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit/releases
If you want to develop debbit or use on Linux follow instructions below.

1. Install the latest version of Firefox
2. Download the latest geckodriver for your OS from here https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
    Extract the zip/tar.gz and place `geckodriver` (or `geckodriver.exe`) in the same directory as debbit.py
    If using windows, you will need to rename `geckodriver.exe` to `geckodriver`
3. Copy and rename the file `sample_config.txt` to `config.txt` in the same directory
4. Configure your python3 environment and dependencies

    These instructions will vary somewhat depending on your platform. For example,
    if your system already has Python3 then you'll use `pip` instead of `pip3`. If
    you don't have pip installed, search on Google for how to install pip.

    # install pipenv
    pip3 install --user pipenv
    pip3 install --user --upgrade pipenv

    cd debbit/src

    # install dependencies listed in Pipfile
    pipenv install

    # run debbit via pipenv
    pipenv run python debbit.py
